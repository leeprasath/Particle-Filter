# Overview
Implementing a particle filter to solve the localization challenge proposed by UDACITY:

>_"Your robot has been kidnapped and transported to a new location! Luckily it has a map of this location, a (noisy) GPS estimate of its initial location, and lots of (noisy) sensor and control data."_



## Running the Code
The project employs the simulation environment provided by UDACITY which can be downloaded from [here](https://youtu.be/0SbVwwY_NuQ).

This repository includes two files that can be used to set up and intall [uWebSocketIO](https://github.com/uWebSockets/uWebSockets) for either Linux or Mac systems. For windows you can use either Docker, VMware, or even [Windows 10 Bash on Ubuntu](https://www.howtogeek.com/249966/how-to-install-and-use-the-linux-bash-shell-on-windows-10/) to install uWebSocketIO.

Once the install for uWebSocketIO is complete, the main program can be built and ran by doing the following from the project top directory.

1. ./clean.sh
2. ./build.sh
3. ./run.sh
